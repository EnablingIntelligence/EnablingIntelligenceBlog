I am a software developer and artificial intelligence student at the Johannes Kepler University (JKU) in Linz. My passion
lies in the field of artificial intelligence, particularly the intricate mathematical foundations that underpin its capabilities.
Eager to share my enthusiasm and knowledge, I've launched the blog "Enabling Intelligence" with the goal of educating

AI, making it accessible and engaging for a wider audience while highlighting its potential to positively impact our world.
