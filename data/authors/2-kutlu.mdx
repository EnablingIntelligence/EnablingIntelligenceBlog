I am a student of Artificial Intelligence at Johannes Kepler University (JKU) in Linz. 
My current aim is to immerse myself in areas such as Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and numerical optimization, 
with the intention of building a comprehensive knowledge base. 
The insights gained through this dedicated endeavor are something I am enthusiastic about sharing through the blog "Enabling Intelligence." 
By actively participating in potential knowledge exchanges, I aim not only to contribute valuable insights 
but also to facilitate mutual growth and development within the field.
